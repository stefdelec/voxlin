    <h1>Voxlin</h1>
    <h3>A decentralized protocol for secure wallet address management</h3>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Voxlin is a cutting-edge protocol that enables users to securely manage multiple wallet addresses while maintaining security and control. By leveraging cryptographic proofs, Voxlin ensures that users can prove the ownership of their wallet addresses with one wallet.</p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Domain Name Linking:</strong> Voxlin allows users to link multiple wallet addresses to a domain name, similar to ENS. These links can be registered for free.</li>
    <li><strong>Flexible Domain Management:</strong> Domains are acquired through payment in VLN for a specific period of time. After the time period expires, users can retain their linked addresses and assign them to a new domain name. Domains can be sold without affecting the linked addresses.</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple Assignments:</strong> A single set of linked addresses can be assigned to multiple domain names, providing flexibility in managing your digital identity across various platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Soulbound Tokens:</strong> Each domain name comes with a Soulbound token, which serves as the user's profile. This profile can include links to a website, avatar images, and more, providing a highly customizable user experience.</li>
</ul>


    <h2>Token Sale</h2>
    <p>The Voxlin ICO will involve the sale of a utility token that will enable participants to interact with the protocol, access premium features, and take part in governance decisions. Funds raised during the ICO will be used to further develop and improve the Voxlin protocol, ensuring its widespread adoption and success.</p>
