        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Voxlin is a cutting-edge protocol that enables users to securely manage multiple wallet addresses while maintaining privacy and control. By leveraging Merkle trees and cryptographic proofs, Voxlin ensures that users can prove the ownership of their wallet addresses without revealing any additional information.</p>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> Voxlin uses Merkle trees to store hashes of wallet addresses, keeping the original addresses hidden and preventing reverse-engineering.</li>
            <li><strong>Proof of Ownership:</strong> Users can provide Merkle proofs to confirm their control over specific wallet addresses without disclosing any other addresses in the set.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Voxlin protocol incorporates signed proofs to ensure the validity and authorization of wallet addresses included in the Merkle tree.</li>
            <li><strong>Flexible Integration:</strong> Voxlin can be integrated with various services such as token gating, multi-signature wallets, and decentralized applications to enhance user privacy and security.</li>
